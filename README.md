# MNIST_Image_Classifcation_Using_Tensorflow
## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The implementation includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
